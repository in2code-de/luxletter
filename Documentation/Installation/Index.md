# Luxletter - Email marketing in TYPO3

Send newsletters the easy way

## Installation

Extension luxletter should be installed via composer

```
composer require "in2code/luxletter"
```

**Note:** TYPO3 in composer mode is needed

TYPO3 11.5 or 12.4 is required. The free extension lux can be also installed for more analysis but is not necessary.


### Basic settings in extension configuration

| Field                         | Tab    | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multilanguage mode            | Basic  | 0             | This mode allows to parse pages with all localized versions. No external sources can be parsed in multilanguage mode - only internal pages.                                                                                                         |
| Show receiver action          | Basic  | 1             | Show receiver action: Show link to receiver view in newsletter module. This view is maybe disturbing if you don't use extension lux in addition.                                                                                                    |
| Add unsubscribe URL to header | Basic  | 1             | Add unsubscribe URL to mail header: Tell mail client how to unsubscribe via List-Unsubscribe header.                                                                                                                                                |
| Rewrite links in newsletter   | Mail   | 1             | Rewrite links in newsletter: Absolute links in your newsletters can be rewritten automatically, to track all link clicks. If you disable this feature, clicks are not tracked.                                                                      |
| Embed images                  | Mail   | 0             | Images with absolute url can automatically be embedded into newsletter mails. File will be stored temporary under `uploads/tx_luxletter/` when newsletters are generated. Attention: This will slow down the sending process (about 10s per email). |
| Build queue via cronjob       | Mail   | 0             | If you have a lot of recipients together with a small memory_limit, a white page or an error could occur when saving a newsletter in backend module. With this change, the queue must be build later via scheduler task (see luxletter:buildqueue). |
| Doktype for Multilanguage     | Expert | 11            | The value is used for the pages doktype field in your instance, if the default value 11 is already used for other stuff, you can change it here.                                                                                                    |
| Add typenum                   | Expert | 1562349004    | Add typenum: Everytime you parse a html for a new newsletter, this type will be added (can be used in fluidStyledMailContent). This will work only for PID in origin, not for absolute URL.                                                         |
| Limit mails in context        | Expert |               | Limit mails in context: If you run testinstances beside production, you can limit mail sending to a defined context (empty = no limit). Example "Production" or "Development/Docker".                                                               |

### Site configuration

You must define one unsubscribe pid per site configuration. This is relevant to the unsubscribe plugin of luxletter. You
can also use a pid outside the site or simply use one unsubscribe page for multiple sites. Nevertheless, the PID must
be defined in every site configuration.

**Attention** Be aware to use a full domain name in base (Entry point) settings of your site configuration. Good: `https://www.domain.org/` - Bad: `/`

### Sender configuration

A sender configuration can be added via list module in every folder page in backend.

| Field          | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Title          | Your internal title for this sender configuration                                                    |
| Sender email   | Sender email address for newsletter email                                                            |
| Sender name    | Sender name for newsletter email                                                                     |
| Reply to email | Email address when a receiver wants to send an answer to the newsletter                              |
| Reply to name  | Name when a receiver wants to send an answer to the newsletter                                       |
| Site           | This defines your domain/site and is needed for the unsubscribe plugin and for building absolute URI |

### TypoScript

Basically there are two different TypoScripts from LUXletter. One should be included manually in static templates in
your root template:

* `FluidStyledMailContent` static template helps to render content in a way email needs (with html from the hell for outlook & co.)

<img src="../Images/documentation_installation_statictyposcript.png" width="800" alt="add static typoscript" />

#### Basic

The basic Typoscript is splitted into some files (see Folders and files in EXT:luxletter/Configuration/TypoScript/Basic/*)

#### FluidStyledMailContent

This TypoScript can be found on EXT:luxletter/Configuration/TypoScript/FluidStyledMailContent/

As soon as a page is opened with `&type=1562349004` the same content should be shown but with some very ugly markup.
Tables and oldschool stuff helps to create newsletters for old email clients like Outlook 200? and so on.

**Note** Not all content elements are supported. If there is a content element that could not be rendered the old way, a
message will show you the state in frontend.

<img src="../Images/documentation_installation_fluidstyledmailcontent_notsupported.png" width="800" alt="render failure" />

**Note** If you want to overwrite the default rendering of FluidStyledMailContent output, have a look at the folder
EXT:lux/Resources/Private/FluidStyledMailContent/ and overwrite the path in your own extension.


### Add page for a unsubscribe plugin

Of course there is an unsubscribe plugin build in into luxletter (in reality, there are two plugins for that).
Create a new page that is accessible for normal website users (can be disabled in menus) and add a plugin of type
- a) `LUXletter: Quick unsubscribe` or
- b) `LUXletter: Unsubscribe with category selection`
on it.

**Note** Don't forget to add the page identifier to the main extension settings (see above) after that.

**Note 2** Unsubscribing is only possible if a hash is added to the link call.
See `{luxletter:mail.getUnsubscribeUrl(newsletter:newsletter,user:user,site:site)}` in the newsletter layout
on EXT:lux/Resources/Private/Templates/Mail/NewsletterContainer.html

#### a) Quick unsubscribe plugin

<img src="../Images/documentation_installation_unsubscribeplugin.png" width="800" alt="quick unsubscribe plugin" />

If someone unsubscribes from a newsletter, LUXletter will simply remove the receiver usergroup from
this user (all other groups will be kept). The user will not be deleted from the system.

Editors can add a message that should appear if a user just unsubscribed.

#### b) Unsubscribe with category selection plugin

<img src="../Images/documentation_installation_unsubscribeplugin2.png" width="800" alt="extended unsubscribe plugin backend" />

<img src="../Images/documentation_installation_unsubscribeplugin2_frontend.png" alt="extended unsubscribe plugin frontend" />

This plugin allows a newsletter receiver to choose between different usergroups. So, here is a chance that he will not
remove all receiver groups at once.
The editor chooses groups in the plugin that are shown in frontend. Only this groups can be selected
(those groups are added to the user if not yet) or deselected (those groups are removed from the user if not yet) by
the user in frontend.
If the user has any other related groups that are not shown in frontend selection - they will be untouched and still
there, even if the user deselects all groups.


### Define fe_groups records for receiver groups

Luxletter needs fe_users records with valid email addresses to send newsletters. And TYPO3 needs you to set
a usergroup (or some usergroups) per frontenduser.
And luxletter allows you to send newsletters to frontendusers of defined groups.
Open a group and check `Is newsletter receiver group` for groups that should get newsletters in future.

<img src="../Images/documentation_installation_fegroups.png" width="800" alt="fe_groups records" />


### Define fe_users.luxletter_language (only for multilanguage mode)

If luxletter runs in multilanguage mode, you can define which fe_user record prefers which language. Just open
such a record and select a specific value for field `luxletter_language`.


### Connect a mailserver

If you don't set a mail configuration for luxletter,
the default mail configuration from TYPO3 will be used when sending newsletters.

Nevertheless it's highly recommended to set a different mailserver for your newsletter configuration to prevent
that your complete server will be marked as spam on some cases.
Such settings can simply be done in your typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php file like:

```
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL_LUXLETTER']['transport'] = 'smtp';
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL_LUXLETTER']['transport_smtp_server'] = 'sslout.de:465';
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL_LUXLETTER']['transport_smtp_encrypt'] = 'ssl';
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL_LUXLETTER']['transport_smtp_username'] = 'username';
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL_LUXLETTER']['transport_smtp_password'] = 'password';
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL_LUXLETTER']['transport_smtp_port'] = '465';
```

**Note** All default mail configurations of TYPO3 can be used but the key would be `MAIL_LUXLETTER` now.


### Configure the queue task

If you add newsletters, they will be parsed and saved as `ready for dispatch` into a queue table.
This queue has to be processed step by step and you could use the scheduler backend module for this task.

#### Scheduler task

Just add a new task of type `Execute console commands (scheduler)`. After that, you can select
`luxletter:queue: Send a bunch of emails from the queue`. A new field will appear
`How many mails should be send per wave?`. This number allows you to send X email at once to the mailserver.

**Note** Be careful and don't set this number too high to keep the mailserver save. A number between 50 and 250 is a
good solution.

**Note** If your TYPO3-Backend is getting locked after using the scheduler-task, delete the file "LOCK_BACKEND" in typo3conf and be sure to have set the correct "Schedulable Command". BTW: If you forgot to set "Frequency" initially, TYPO3 sets the Command back to "backend:lock".

<img src="../Images/documenation_installation_scheduler2.png" width="800" alt="scheduler task 2" />

#### CLI

As an alternative, you could also process the queue directly from the console:

```
# Send 50 newsletters that are queued
./vendor/bin/typo3 luxletter:queue

# Send a specific number of newsletters from queue
./vendor/bin/typo3cms luxletter:queue 10

# Send some queued newsletters from newsletter with uid 123
./vendor/bin/typo3cms luxletter:queue 10 123
```
