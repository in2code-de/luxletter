## Breaking changes !!!

### Upgrade to 13.x

* If you have extended luxletter via slots (signalslots), you have to adjust your code by using PSR-14 eventdispatchers now
  * Because we wanted to reduce technical debt and because making future updates for TYPO3 12 easier, we already switched to eventdispatchers
  * All places that were extended with signals are now extended with eventdispatchers
  * See official documentation how to use eventlisteners https://docs.typo3.org/p/brotkrueml/schema/main/en-us/Developer/Events.html

### Upgrade to 11.x

* Definition of Container filenames in TypoScript has changed a bit - default layout name is `NewsletterContainer`
  * Because we now support multilanguage configuration, it's possible to add layout files per language.
  * Now we don't need to add `.html` to the definition
  * Todo: Remove the extension in TypoScript setup: `plugin.tx_luxletter_fe.settings.containerHtml.options.1.fileName=NewsletterContainer.html` => `plugin.tx_luxletter_fe.settings.containerHtml.options.1.fileName=NewsletterContainer`
* Command `luxletter:createnewsletterfromorigin`
  * has a new parameter "language" now
  * has a different ordering of parameters now
  * Todo: If you are using this command, update your scheduler task or CLI command (see documentation)
* Signal `\In2code\Luxletter\Domain\Service\Parsing\NewsletterUrl::constructor`
  * has only one parameter now: NewsletterUrl object (with getter and setter for uri, origin and language)
  * Todo: If you are using this signal, adjust your slot


### Upgrade to 8.x

Container HTML template is now configured differently to allow a selection from editors.
While it was before 8.0 used from `templateRootPath/Mail/NewsletterContainer.html`, we can now configure a path with
more than one container template via TypoScript:

```
plugin {
  tx_luxletter_fe {
    settings {
      # Define container.html files
      containerHtml {
        path = EXT:yoursitepackage/Resources/Private/Templates/Mail/
        options {
          1 {
            label = LLL:EXT:yoursitepackage/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:newsletter.layouts.1
            fileName = MyContainer1.html
          }
          2 {
            label = My Layout 2
            fileName = MyContainer2.html
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Already existing newsletters without new layout property will not be send any more!


### Upgrade to 5.x

This is only a small breaking change. CSS files are included via TypoScript now. So we removed the partial ZurbCss.html
and put all css now to EXT:luxletter/Resources/Private/Css/.
Todo: Remove the partial call in NewsletterContainer.html template file.


### Upgrade to 4.x

Multiple senders can now be defined in records, in addition it's not needed to define a domain in extension configuration
any more. We now look into site configuration. But that change needs you to adjust some stuff.

Breaking changes in detail and what you have to do step by step after you have updated the extension:

* Add one (ore more) record(s) with sender information on any sysfolder
* Update your site configuration with an unsubscribe pid (so you could use different unsubscribe plugins now)
* Take care that your base (Entry point) settings in site configuration is not just `/` but a full domain prefix like `https://www.domain.org/`
* Create new newsletter records with the new sender configuration. **Note:** Old newsletters won't be queued any more because a sender configuration is missing
* Update your HTML template files (compare your files with `EXT:luxletter/Resources/Private/Templates/Mail/NewsletterContainer.html`)
    * If you are using the viewhelper `luxletter:mail.getUnsubscribeUrl` now another argument must be passed: `site` - example: `{luxletter:mail.getUnsubscribeUrl(newsletter:newsletter,user:user,site:site)}`
    * If you are usint the viewhelper `luxletter:configuration.getDomain` also `site` must be passed as argument - example: `{luxletter:configuration.getDomain(site:site)}`
    * If you have changed the TrackingPixel.html partial file, take also care that `site` is now passed to `luxletter:mail.getTrackingPixelUrl` - example: `{luxletter:mail.getTrackingPixelUrl(newsletter:newsletter,user:user,site:site)}`
